comment = "Q> What algorithm is this code implementing?\n\nA> The snippet is implementing the Luhn Algorithm, which is used to validate a v\nariety of identification numbers such as credit card numbers and national provid\ner identifier numbers in the US. In this code, it processes an ascii_string as i\nnput, reads each digit in the string from right to left, doubles the value of ev\nery second digit and then finds the sum of the digits. This sum is then used for\n validation.\n"
