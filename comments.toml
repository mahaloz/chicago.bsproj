This algorithm r\neads each digit in a string from the right to the left, doubles the value of eve\nry second digit, and finds the sum of the digits. The sum is then used for valid\nation.\n\n"

In this code, it processes an ascii_string as i\nnput, reads each digit in the string from right to left, doubles the value of ev\nery second digit and then finds the sum of the digits.
