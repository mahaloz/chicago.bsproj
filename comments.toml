comment = "Q> What algorithm is this code implementing?\n\nA> The snippet is implementing the Luhn Algorithm, which is used to validate a variety of identification numbers such as credit card numbers and national provider identifier numbers in the US. In this code, it processes an ascii_string as input, reads each digit in the string from right to left, doubles the value of every second digit and then finds the sum of the digits. This sum is then used for validation."
